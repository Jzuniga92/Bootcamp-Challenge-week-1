# CODE REFACTORING 
In this challange I refactored the code to be web accessible for users. 

## REPLACING THE <DIV> TAGS
On the HTML page we have refactored the <div> tags to semantic elements that will correspond with the CSS stylingsheet

In the CSS styling sheet you will see the <div> tags were replaced with the <nav> tags to properly indentify the content.
